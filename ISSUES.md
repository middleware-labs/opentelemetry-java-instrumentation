# Issues

## Labels

### `needs author feedback`

This is something that needs additional clarification from the author.

Note: issues with this label are automatically marked stale if there is no activity for 7 days,
and then closed automatically if there is no response from the author within 7 days after that.

### `needs repro`

Repros are helpful for a lot of issues (not only for bugs).

They allow the maintainers (and others) to much better understand exactly what the
issue author is trying to do, and what they expect to happen.

Ideally repros should be minimal, should be posted to a github repository,
and should include a `README.md` which explains exactly how to build and run the repro,
what the output of the repro is, and what you expect (or would like) the output of
the repro to be.

Note: issues with this label are automatically marked stale if there is no activity for 30 days,
and then closed automatically if there is no response from the author within 30 days after that.

### `contribution welcome`

This is something that fits the scope of the project.
The maintainers aren't planning to implement it, but would welcome and help review if
someone else wants to implement and contribute it to the project.

Note: issues with this label are automatically closed if there is no activity for 365 days.
